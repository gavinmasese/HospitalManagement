HospitalManagement
==================

Simple Hospital Management System
1. Basic Hospital Management System

This is a programming and database management app designed as a centralized system for hospitals to digitize and handle huge data ( like patient details, appointments made, results of lab tests, patient diagnosis information, etc.). This is one of the best computer science project ideas that can add value to your resume.  

Developing a hospital management system is easy for beginners. A functional and effective hospital management system can be created with the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

The system should be able to receive new entries, store them safely and enable hospital staff and system administrators to access, and use the data. 

You should develop the hospital management system in a way that it should assign a unique ID to each patient registered at the hospital. The system must include all necessary details of hospital staff besides patients in a local database.  
When the data increases, it becomes challenging for the staff and hospital administrator to find the required data of a particular patient or staff. So, it is important to have search functionality to make the search process across thousands of data much easier.  

While it is enough to use the local storage to run the hospital management, you can also use a cloud database. Both of them have their pros and cons. You must leverage the advantages and disadvantages to make the computer science topics more challenging and interesting. Check out this Github project for reference.
